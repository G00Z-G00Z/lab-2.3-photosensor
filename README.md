# Activity 2.3 Light sensor

# Introduction

Use a LDR (photoresitor) to classify **light levels of ambient light** with a
fuzzy-like approach (dim, dark, comfotable, etc)

- Must use at least 4 classes to describe the light level.
- Must use info from sensor to tell the distance from the surface.

## Requirements

- Describe levels of light with fuzzy logic
    - Must have 4 levels
    - Must display in lcd
- Model the data from the transducer
    - Voltage vs distance
- Use libraries to handle code
- User interface
    - LCD shows: 
        - Distance and Ambient Light class
    - LED: Brightness is inversely proportional as the light hitting the sensor (compensates for lack of light)


# Instructions for using template

- Download **vscode**
- Download the extension of **PlatformIO IDE** in vscode
- Open the project
